# Introduction

Combinatorics.js is a standalone math library for Javascript and Node.js. It features a solution to work with Permutations, Posets, Trees, and other enumerative collections.

Combinatorics.js is also a module to [math.js](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs).

Please see [this blog article](http://www.devanpatel.me/writing-a-combinatorics-module-for-math-js/) to get a general feel for this project.

# Install/Build

To clone this project:
```
git clone git@github.com:devanp92/combinatorics.js.git
cd combinatorics.js
```

To install the necessary dependencies:
```
npm install
```

To test we use Mocha:

```
npm test // mocha test --recursive
```

To build we use Gulp:

```
gulp
```

# Roadmap

A rough roadmap for Combinatorics.js

Permutation: Ï€ : {1...m} -> {1...m}:

* Behaviors
  * <s>Inverse</s>
  * <s>Multiply</s>
  * <s>Calculate number of cycles</s>
  * <s>Complement</s>
  * <s>Reverse</s>
  * <s>Randomize Permutation</s>
* States
  * <s>Number of cycles</s>
  * <s>Parity (odd/even)</s>
  * Number of fixed points (is it a Derangement?)
  * <s>Is Identity</s>
* Ancillary
  * Create/Return iterator
  * <s>Print to cycle notation</s>

Util Functions

* <s>Is Integer</s>
* <s>Combinations</s>
* Enumerative Methods
  * Bell Numbers
  * Stirling numbers of the first kind
  * Partitions
    * (Weak) Compositions
    * Set Partitions
      * Stirling numbers of the second kind
    * Integer Paritions

# Contributing

Feel free to contribute to combinatorics.js! You can contribute in different ways: spread the word, report bugs, come up with ideas and suggestions, and contribute to the code.

There are a few preferences regarding code contributions:

    Combinatorics.js follows the node.js code style
    Send pull requests to the develop branch, not the master branch.
    Pleae do not commit any files other than in lib/ and test/.
    If adding functionality, please include source (lib/) and test (test/) files.



Thanks!
