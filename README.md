# Combinatorics.js

Combinatorics.js is a standalone math library for Javascript and Node.js. It features a solution to work with Permutations, Posets, Trees, and other enumerative collections.


Please see [this blog article](http://www.devanpatel.me/writing-a-combinatorics-module-for-math-js/) to get a general feel for this project.
# Roadmap

A rough roadmap for Combinatorics.js

Permutation: Ï€ : {1...m} -> {1...m}

* Permutations
  * Behaviors
    * Inverse
    * Multiply
    * Calculate number of cycles
    * Complement
    * Inverse
    * Reverse
    * Generate Random Permutation
  * States
    * Number of cycles
    * Parity (odd/even)
    * Number of fixed points (is it a Derangement?)
    * Is Identity
  * Ancillary
    * Create/Return iterator
    * Print to cycle notation
